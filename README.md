# React Projects

I am learning React.js and in this repository I practice what I have learned. 

## 1. Getting Started with The Appointment App

This is an exercise to review React fundumentals. It's developed based on a Linkedin's crash course.
This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app), Tailwind, React Icons, useState.

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.
